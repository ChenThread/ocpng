ocpng: open a png in opencomputers

MIT-licensed, see the file itself

it's a bit incomplete, so please get in touch if your pngs depend on the following:

* the other two deflate block types, they spew these errors (please try the images without a data card):
  * error("TODO: stored deflate block")
  * error("TODO: fixed huffman deflate block")
* monochrome images
* 16bpc images (that is, 48/64bpp)

basically i need more test cases
